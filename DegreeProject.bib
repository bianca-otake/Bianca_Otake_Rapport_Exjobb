	abstract = {Recent developments in sensor technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems ({GNSS}), Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}), Light Detection and Ranging ({LiDAR}), radar, and camera have led to emerging state-of-the-art autonomous systems, such as driverless vehicles or {UAS} (Unmanned Airborne Systems) swarms. These technologies necessitate the use of accurate object space information about the physical environment around the platform. This information can be generally provided by the suitable selection of the sensors, including sensor types and capabilities, the number of sensors, and their spatial arrangement. Since all these sensor technologies have different error sources and characteristics, rigorous sensor modeling is needed to eliminate/mitigate errors to obtain an accurate, reliable, and robust integrated solution. Mobile mapping systems are very similar to autonomous vehicles in terms of being able to reconstruct the environment around the platforms. However, they differ a lot in operations and objectives. Mobile mapping vehicles use professional grade sensors, such as geodetic grade {GNSS}, tactical grade {IMU}, mobile {LiDAR}, and metric cameras, and the solution is created in post-processing. In contrast, autonomous vehicles use simple/inexpensive sensors, require real-time operations, and are primarily interested in identifying and tracking moving objects. In this study, the main objective was to assess the performance potential of autonomous vehicle sensor systems to obtain high-definition maps based on only using Velodyne sensor data for creating accurate point clouds. In other words, no other sensor data were considered in this investigation. The results have confirmed that cm-level accuracy can be achieved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the 76GHz {MWR} (Millimeter-Wave Radar)-based self-localization method for automated driving during snowfall. Previously, there were many {LIDAR} (Light Detection and Ranging)-based localization techniques proposed for high measurement accuracy and robustness to changes of day and night. However, they did not provide effective approaches for snow conditions because of sensing noise (i.e., environmental resistance) created by snowfall. Therefore, this paper developed a {MWR}-based map generation and a real-time localization method by modeling the uncertainties of error propagation. Quantitative evaluations are performed on driving data with and without snow conditions, using a {LIDAR}-based method as the baseline. Experimental results show that a lateral root mean square error of about 0. 25m can be obtained, regardless of the presence or absence of snowfall. Thus, it can be investigated that a potential performance of radar-based localization.},

We use weak supervision together with inertial measurement fusion to train a classifier that exploits the principal eigenvector associated with our radar scan matching algorithm at run-time and produces a prior belief in the robot's motion estimate. This prior is used in a filtering framework to correct for vehicle motion estimates. We demonstrate the system on a challenging outdoor dataset, for which current radar motion estimation algorithms fail frequently. By knowing when failure is likely, we achieve qualitatively superior motion estimates and quantitatively fewer odometry failures. Specifically, we see 24.7 \% fewer failures in motion estimation over the course of a 15.81 km drive through a difficult, mixed rural-and-urban scene, with lower {RMSE} in translational and rotational estimates during particularly challenging conditions.},

	abstract = {Current anthropogenic climate change is the result of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere, which records the aggregation of billions of individual decisions. Here we consider a broad range of individual lifestyle choices and calculate their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, based on 148 scenarios from 39 sources. We recommend four widely applicable high-impact (i.e. low emissions) actions with the potential to contribute to systemic change and substantially reduce annual personal emissions: having one fewer child (an average for developed countries of 58.6 tonnes {CO}2-equivalent ({tCO}2e) emission reductions per year), living car-free (2.4 {tCO}2e saved per year), avoiding airplane travel (1.6 {tCO}2e saved per roundtrip transatlantic ﬂight) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 {tCO}2e saved per year). These actions have much greater potential to reduce emissions than commonly promoted strategies like comprehensive recycling (four times less effective than a plant-based diet) or changing household lightbulbs (eight times less). Though adolescents poised to establish lifelong patterns are an important target group for promoting high-impact actions, we ﬁnd that ten high school science textbooks from Canada largely fail to mention these actions (they account for 4\% of their recommended actions), instead focusing on incremental changes with much smaller potential emissions reductions. Government resources on climate change from the {EU}, {USA}, Canada, and Australia also focus recommendations on lower-impact actions. We conclude that there are opportunities to improve existing educational and communication structures to promote the most effective emission-reduction strategies and close this mitigation gap.},

We show that the algorithm produces very optimistic estimates once the “true” uncertainty in vehicle heading exceeds a limit. This failure is subtle and cannot, in general, be detected without ground-truth, although a very inconsistent ﬁlter may exhibit observable symptoms, such as disproportionately large jumps in the vehicle pose update. Conventional solutions—adding stabilising noise, using an iterated {EKF} or unscented ﬁlter, etc—do not improve the situation. However, if “small” heading uncertainty is maintained, {EKF}-{SLAM} exhibits consistent behaviour over an extended time-period. Although the uncertainty estimate slowly becomes optimistic, inconsistency can be mitigated indeﬁnitely by applying tactics such as batch updates or stabilising noise. The manageable degradation of small heading variance {SLAM} indicates the efﬁcacy of submap methods for large-scale maps.},

The technique consists in computing the vehicle prior using an Unscented Transformation. The {UT} allows a better nonlinear mean and variance estimation than the {EKF}. There is no need however in using the {UT} for the entire vehiclemap state, given the linearity in the map part of the model. By applying the {UT} only to the vehicle states we get more accurate covariance estimates. The a posteriori estimation is made using a fully observable {EKF} step, thus preserving the same computational complexity as the {EKF} with sequential innovation. Experiments over a standard {SLAM} data set show the behavior of the algorithm.},

In this paper, we present a reliable and accurate radar-only motion estimation algorithm for mobile autonomous systems. Using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave ({FMCW}) scanning radar, we first extract landmarks with an algorithm that accounts for unwanted effects in radar returns. To estimate relative motion, we then perform scan matching by greedily adding point correspondences based on unary descriptors and pairwise compatibility scores.

Typically, onboard sensors are used to localize the vehicle precisely in a previously recorded map. However, these solutions are sensitive to ambient lighting conditions such as darkness and inclement weather. Additionally, the maps can become outdated in a rapidly changing environment and require continuous updating. While {LiDAR} systems don't require visible light, they are sensitive to weather such as fog or snow, which can interfere with localization. In this letter, we utilize a Ground Penetrating Radar ({GPR}) to obtain precise vehicle localization. By mapping and localizing using features beneath the ground, we obtain features that are both stable over time, and maintain their appearance during changing ambient weather and lighting conditions. We incorporate this solution into a full-scale autonomous vehicle and evaluate the performance on over 17 km of testing data in a variety of challenging weather conditions. We find that this novel sensing modality is capable of providing precise localization for autonomous navigation without using cameras or {LiDAR} sensors.},

This makes map-relative localization an essential skill. In this paper, we address the problem of localization with automotive-grade radars, using a real-time graph-based {SLAM} approach. The system uses landmarks and odometry information as an abstraction layer. This way, besides radars, all kind of different sensor modalities including cameras and lidars can contribute. A single, semantic landmark map is used and maintained for all sensors. We implemented our approach using C++ and thoroughly tested it on data obtained with our test vehicles, comprising cars and trucks. Test scenarios include inner cities and industrial areas like container terminals. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that the approach is able to provide a precise and stable pose in structured environments, using radar data alone. The fusion of additional sensor information from cameras or lidars further boost performance, providing reliable semantic information needed for automated mapping.},

	abstract = {An ego-motion estimation method based on the spatial and Doppler information obtained by an automotive radar is proposed. The estimation of the motion state vector is performed in a density-based framework. Compared to standard vehicle odometry the approach is capable to estimate the full two dimensional motion state with three degrees of freedom. The measurement of a Doppler radar sensor is represented as a mixture of Gaussians. This mixture is matched with the mixture of a previous measurement by applying the appropriate egomotion transformation. The parameters of the transformation are found by the optimization of a suitable join metric. Due to the Doppler information the method is very robust against disturbances by moving objects and clutter. It provides excellent results for highly nonlinear movements. Real world results of the proposed method are presented. The measurements are obtained by a 77GHz radar sensor mounted on a test vehicle. A comparison using a high-precision inertial measurement unit with differential {GPS} support is made. The results show a high accuracy in velocity and yaw-rate estimation.},

	abstract = {In order to tackle the challenge of unfavorable weather conditions such as rain and snow, radar is being revisited as a parallel sensing modality to vision and lidar. Recent works have made tremendous progress in applying spinning radar to odometry and place recognition. However, these works have so far ignored the impact of motion distortion and Doppler effects on spinning-radar-based navigation, which may be significant in the self-driving car domain where speeds can be high. In this work, we demonstrate the effect of these distortions on radar odometry using the Oxford Radar {RobotCar} Dataset and metric localization using our own data-taking platform. We revisit a lightweight estimator that can recover the motion between a pair of radar scans while accounting for both effects. Our conclusion is that both motion distortion and the Doppler effect are significant in different aspects of spinning radar navigation, with the former more prominent than the latter.

	abstract = {Occupancy grids ({OG}) are widely used for low-level fusion of radar data in various automotive applications. At the core of {OG} generation, usually, there is an inverse sensor model ({ISM}), which is a conditional cell occupancy probability model. Traditional {ISM}'s lack mechanisms decreasing occupancy likelihoods along directions that produce no detections; thus, false detections tend to perpetuate on the {OG}. In this paper, we propose a novel Inverse Sensor Model including a “positive” component describing occupancy probabilities induced by radar detections and a “negative” component handling lack of detections in a given direction. This dual model proves especially useful in multi-sensor/multi-frame context since false detections by different radars and/or at different moments are uncorrelated and thus can be efficiently mitigated.},

	abstract = {Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as {GPS}. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efﬁcient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating {SLAM} is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by ﬁnding the spatial conﬁguration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based {SLAM} problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the {SLAM} problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},
