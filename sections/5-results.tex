\section{Factors affecting the quality of the localization}
The main factor affecting the ability of the algorithm to localize
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distance from and abundance of static features to the vehicle
    \item Resolution of the maps
    \item Clutter and echo in radar data
\end{itemize}
The main factors affecting the speed of the algorithm 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Size, and resolution of the maps that are to be matched with each other
    \item Map construction and correlation method
\end{itemize}
